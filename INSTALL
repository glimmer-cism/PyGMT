1. Unpack the source tar ball, using tar
   tar xvzf PyGMT-0.0.tar.gz

2. Set the environment variable GMTINC to where the GMT header file 
   gmt_grd.h is installed.

3. Run the setup script:
   ./setup.py install --home=DIR_WHERE_YOU_WANT_THE_STUFF_TO_GO
	         
   Use --home to specify a non-standard installation directory. If you do 
   that, you will need to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to point 
   to this directory in order for python to find the module. Furthermore, 
   the netCDFlibrary is required. setup.py looks for the header files in 
   the standard locations, i.e. /usr/include and /usr/local/include.

4. Run the example/test scripts in the test directory. By issuing commands like
   python test_areaxy.py
   These scripts should also give a first impression how PyGMT might work. 
   Hopefully, I will get around to add some more documentation.
